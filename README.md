# OOP_Final_Project

The following is the code for the OOP Final project by Student: Bagastya Hazeliman Hendraswara 
Student Number:2902631350

It is a Railway reservation system that is integrated to a Database that saves the client's data and  reservation.

Features:
1. Reserving a train seat through the console.
2. Looking at the customer data through the SQL.
3. Train management, being able to update as well as to add the available train types.

The project

I.	About the Railway Reservation System

The System’s goal is to help passengers reserve their seats for the train that they wish to take. The system is made to be able to be easily understood, the customer simply needs to find a train that match their needs. 
Once the passenger’s matched with the train that they wish to take they are then registered in the database of the system in which their data is stored to be verified when they take the train.
The goal of the system is to streamline the process of reserving a train ticket. Once the passenger inserts the train number of their corresponding ride and personal data the system, once they are in the train station. They can go to the correct platform to board the train.













II.	Proposed System

a.	System

Through this system, the process of viewing, booking, and cancelling train tickets are simple and efficient. Users interact with the system through a console-based interface, and all information is stored and managed in a MySQL database.


 

The user can check availability of trains checking their seat availability, booking, and displaying ticket details and even cancelling their ticket reservations if they change their mind. The system is tailor made to be user friendly without any confusing features. All the user needs to do is to input their choice and follow the system’s instructions.














b.	Reservations

The railway reservation system ensures accessibility to their would-be passengers. The system the way the customer can make reservations for themselves, family members or friends. 
The user’s data will then be stored in the SQL within the SQL, within the view. the administrator of the system can view the passenger’s info as well as their corresponding trains. In addition the admin can also add or delete trains that will be available to the users.


 
  



III.	Future Goals

The objective of the system is to provide an enjoyable experience for users of that need to take trains to their destinations.  User convenience is a primary focus, all the user needs to worry about is to match their starting point and their destinations to reserve their trains. 
For future development, the system can have a function for the admins so that they can add the trains directly into the NetBeans program instead of having to add manually through the SQL database. Furthermore having a search function so the user can have a better experience.![Uploading image.png…]()
